      <h3>API Resources</h3>
      All API URLs listed in this documentation are relative to <b>https://api.goshippo.com/</b>.

      For example, the `/addresses/` resource is reachable at `https://api.goshippo.com/addresses/`.


      <h3>Authentication</h3>
      The API requires Shippo's token HTTP Authentication with your Shippo token (live or test). 

      In order to authenticate properly, please put `Authorization: ShippoToken <token>` in your header. You can find your token on the 
      <a href="https://goshippo.com/user/apikeys/">Shippo API settings page</a>.



      For more information about authentication and test mode, 
      <a href="https://docs.goshippo.com/docs/guides_general/authentication/">please visit our Authentication guide</a>.

      The API is available via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) only. All requests to the Shippo API must use TLS version 1.2 or higher.

      <h3>Request & Response Data</h3>
      Request data is passed to the API by <b>POSTing JSON objects</b> with the appropriate key/value-pairs to the respective 
      resource. The documentation for each API resource contains more details on the values accepted by a given resource.

      Response data also formatted as JSON object. You can specify how many results per page are to be returned. For instance, 
      `/rates/?results=25` will return up to 25 results.

      <h3>REST & Disposable Objects</h3>
      The Shippo API is built around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST principles</a>. 
      Use POST requests to create objects, GET requests to retrieve objects, and PUT requests to update objects.

      Only the Carrier Accounts object can be updated via PUT requests. All other objects such as Addresses, Parcels, 
      Shipments, Rates, Transactions, Refunds, Customs Items, and Customs Declarations are disposable. This means that 
      once you have created an object, you cannot change it. Instead, create a new one with the desired values.

      <h3>API Version</h3>

      This reference guide supports the Shippo API version: `2018-02-08` . 

      To see reference guides for older API versions, see our <a href="https://docs.goshippo.com/docs/guides_general/legacy_reference/">legacy reference guide</a>. 
      For more information about Shippo API versions, see our <a href="https://docs.goshippo.com/docs/api_concepts/apiversioning/">API versions guide</a>.
  - name: Addresses
    description: |-
      Addresses are the locations a parcel is being shipped **from** and **to**. They represent company and residential places. Among other things, you can use address objects to create shipments, calculate shipping rates, and purchase shipping labels.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Address"/>
  - name: Parcels
    description: |-
      A parcel is an item you are shipping. The parcel object includes details about its physical make-up of the parcel. It includes dimensions and weight that Shippo uses to calculate rates. 
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Parcel"/>

      # Parcel Extras
      The following values are supported for the `extra` field of the parcel object.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/ParcelExtra"/>
  - name: Shipments
    description: |-
      A shipment is the act of transporting goods. A shipment object contains **to** and **from** addresses, and the parcel details that you are shipping. You can use the shipment object to retrieve shipping rates and purchase a shipping label.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Shipment"/>
       
      # Shipment Extras
      The following values are supported for the `extra` field of the shipment object.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/ShipmentExtra"/>
  - name: Rates
    description: |-
      A rate is the cost to ship a parcel from a carrier. The rate object details the service level including the cost and transit time. 
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Rate"/>
  - name: Transactions
    x-displayName: Transactions (shipping labels)
    description: |-
      A transaction is the purchase of a shipping label from a shipping provider for a specific service. You can print purchased labels and used them to ship a parcel with a carrier, such as USPS or FedEx.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Transaction"/>
  - name: Customs Items
    description: |-
      Customs declarations are relevant information, including one or multiple customs items, you need to provide for customs clearance for your international shipments.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/CustomsItem"/>
  - name: Customs Declarations
    description: |-
      Customs declarations are relevant information, including one or multiple customs items, you need to provide for 
      customs clearance for your international shipments.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/CustomsDeclaration"/>
  - name: Refunds
    description: |-
      Refunds are reimbursements for successfully created but unused shipping labels or other charges.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Refund"/>
  - name: Manifests
    description: |-
      A manifest is a single-page document with a barcode that carriers can scan to accept all packages into transit without the need to scan each item individually. 
      They are close-outs of shipping labels of a certain day. Some carriers require manifests to  process the shipments.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Manifest"/>

      # Manifest Errors
      The following codes and messages are the possible errors that may occur when creating Manifests.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/ManifestErrors"/>
  - name: Carrier Accounts
    description: |-
      Carriers are the companies who deliver your package. Shippo uses Carrier account objects as credentials to retrieve shipping rates and purchase labels from shipping Carriers.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/CarrierAccount"/>
  - name: Webhooks
    description: |-
      Webhooks are a way for Shippo to notify your application when a specific event occurs. For example, when a label is purchased or when a shipment tracking status has changed. You can use webhooks to trigger actions in your application, such as sending an email or updating a database.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Webhook"/>

      # Webhook Payload
      The payload is the body of the POST request Shippo sends to the URL specified at the time of webhook registration.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/WebhookPayload"/>
  - name: Tracking Status
    description: |-
      <p style="text-align: center; background-color: #F2F3F4;"></br>
      If you purchased your shipping label through Shippo, you can also get all the tracking details of your Shipment 
      from the <a href="#tag/Transactions">Transaction</a> object.
      </br></br></p>
      A tracking status of a package is an indication of current location of a package in the supply chain. For example,  sorting, warehousing, or out for delivery. Use the tracking status object to track the location of your shipments.

      When using your <a href="https://docs.goshippo.com/docs/guides_general/authentication/">Test</a> token for tracking, you need to use Shippo's 
      predefined tokens for testing different tracking statuses. You can find more information in our 
      <a href="https://docs.goshippo.com/docs/tracking/tracking/">Tracking tutorial</a> on how to do this, and what the 
      payloads look like.      
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Track"/>
  - name: Batches
    description: |-
      A batch is a technique for creating multiple labels at once. Use the  batch object to create and purchase many shipments in two API calls. After creating the batch, retrieve the batch to verify that all shipments are valid. You can add and remove shipments after you have created the batch. When all shipments are valid you can purchase the batch and retrieve all the shipping labels.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Batch"/>

      # Batch Shipment
      The batch shipment object is a wrapper around a shipment object, which include shipment-specific information 
      for batch processing.

      Note: batch shipments can only be created on the batch endpoint, either when creating a batch object or by through 
      the `/batches/{BATCH_OBJECT_ID}/add_shipments` endpoint
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/BatchShipment"/>
  - name: Orders
    x-displayName: Orders (beta)
    description: |-
      An order is a request from a customer to purchase goods from a merchant. 
      Use the orders object to load orders from your system to the Shippo dashboard.
      You can use the orders object to create, retrieve, list, and manage orders programmatically. 
      You can also retrieve shipping rates, purchase labels, and track shipments for each order.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Order"/>

      # Line Item
      <p style="text-align: center; background-color: #F2F3F4;">
        </br>Line Items, and their corresponding abstract Products and Variants, might be exposed as a separate resource 
        in the future. Currently it's a nested object within the order resource.</br></br>
      </p>
       A line item is an individual object in an order. For example, if your order contains a t-shirt, shorts, and a jacket, each item is represented by a line item.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/LineItem"/>
  - name: Pickups
    description: |-
      A pickup is when you schedule a carrier to collect a package for delivery.
      Use Shippoâ€™s pickups endpoint to schedule pickups with USPS and DHL Express for eligible shipments that you have already created.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Pickup"/>
  - name: Service Groups
    description: |-
      A service group is a set of service levels grouped together. 
      Rates at checkout uses services groups to present available shipping options to customers in their shopping basket.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/ServiceGroup"/>
  - name: Carrier Parcel Templates
    description: |-
      A carrier parcel template represents a package used for shipping that has preset dimensions defined by a carrier. Some examples of a carrier parcel template include USPS Flat Rate Box and Fedex Small Pak. When using a carrier parcel template, the rates returned may be limited to the carrier that provides the box. You can create user parcel templates using a carrier parcel template. Shippo takes the dimensions of the carrier parcel template but you must configure the weight.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/CarrierParcelTemplate"/>
  - name: User Parcel Templates
    description: |-
      A user parcel template represents a package used for shipping that has preset dimensions and attributes defined 
      by you. They are useful for capturing attributes of parcel-types you frequently use for shipping, allowing 
      them to be defined once and then used for many shipments. These parcel templates can also be used for live rates.

      User parcel templates can also be created using a carrier parcel template, where the dimensions will be copied from 
      the carrier presets, but the weight can be configured by you.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/UserParcelTemplate"/>
  - name: Rates at Checkout
    description: |-
      Rates at checkout is a tool for merchants to display up-to-date shipping estimates based on what's in their customers cart and where theyâ€™re shipping to.
      Merchants set up curated shipping options for customers in the checkout flow based on data in the shopping cart. The request must include the **to** address and item information. Optional fields are the **from** address and package information. If the optional fields are not included, the service will use the default address and/or package configured for rates at checkout. The response is a list of shipping options based on the Service Group configuration.
      (see <a href="#tag/Service-Groups">Service Group configuration</a> for details).
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/LiveRate"/>


      # Default Parcel Template
      Assign one of your user parcel templates to be the default used when generating Live Rates. This template will be used by default when generating Live Rates, unless you explicitly provide a parcel in the Live Rates request.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/UserParcelTemplate"/>
  - name: Carriers
    description: <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/CarriersEnum"/>
  - name: Service Levels
    description: <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/ServiceLevelEnumSet"/>
  - name: Parcel Templates
    description: |-
      A predefined package used by one or multiple carriers.  See below for all available values and the corresponding tokens. 
      When a template is given, the parcel dimensions do not have to be sent, the dimensions below will instead be used. 
      The parcel weight is not affected by the use of a template.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/ParcelTemplateEnumSet"/>
  - name: Shippo Accounts
    description: |-
      Shippo Accounts are used by Shippo Platform Accounts to create and manage Managed Shippo Accounts. 
      Managed Shippo Accounts are headless accounts that represent your customers. They are opaque to your end customers, meaning customers do not need to create their own Shippo login or have a billing relationship with Shippo. 
      They can be used by marketplaces, e-commerce platforms, and third-party logistics providers who want to offer, seamless, built-in shipping functionality to their customers. See our <a href="https://docs.goshippo.com/docs/platformaccounts/platform_accounts/">guide</a> for more details.

        Returns a list of all carrier accounts connected to your Shippo account. These carrier accounts include both Shippo carrier accounts and your own carrier accounts that you have connected to your Shippo account.

        Additionally, you can get information about the service levels associated with each carrier account by passing in the `?service_levels=true` query parameter. <br>
        Using it appends the property `service_levels` to each carrier account. <br>
        By default, if the query parameter is omitted, the `service_levels` property will not be included in the response.

        Returns all available shipping rates for a shipment object.

        When you create a new valid shipment object, Shippo automatically calculates all available rates. Depending on your shipment data, there may be none, one or multiple rates.

        By default, the calculated rates will return the price in two currencies under the `amount` and `amount_local` keys, respectively. The `amount` key will contain the price of a rate expressed in the currency that is used in the country from where the parcel originates, and the `amount_local` key will contain the price expressed in the currency that is used in the country the parcel is shipped to. You can request rates with prices expressed in a different currency by adding the currency code to the end of the resource URL. The full list of supported currencies along with their codes can be viewed on <a href="http://openexchangerates.org/api/currencies.json">open exchange rates</a>.

        Note: re-requesting the rates with a different currency code will re-queue the shipment (i.e. set the Shipment's `status` to `QUEUED`) and the converted currency rates will only be available when the Shipment's `status` is set to `SUCCESS`.
