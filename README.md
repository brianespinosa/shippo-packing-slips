# shippo-packing-slips

Automated packing slip and shipping label printer for Shippo orders. Runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W on a cron schedule, fetches recent activity from the Shippo API, and prints to a Knaon thermal printer via CUPS.

See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for full system design.


## Requirements

- Node.js 24
- A Shippo account with a production API token
- CUPS with the Knaon printer configured

```
