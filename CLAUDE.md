# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

See `README.md` for repository overview and contents.

## Shippo API Specification

**IMPORTANT**: Always use the local API specification file instead of fetching from the web.

- **Local spec**: `reference/shippo-api.yaml` (904KB, complete OpenAPI specification)
- **Web URL**: https://docs.goshippo.com/spec/shippoapi/public-api.yaml (same content, but slow to fetch)

**Why local?**
- The spec file is large (904KB) and truncates when fetched via web tools
- Local file access is faster and more reliable
- Contains complete endpoint documentation including `/orders` endpoint at line 9102

**Key endpoints for this project**:
- `GET /orders` - List orders with date filtering (see reference/shippo-api.yaml:9102-9251)
  - Query params: `start_date`, `end_date`, `order_status[]`, `shop_app`, `page`
  - Date format: ISO 8601 UTC (e.g., `2026-02-02T14:00:00`)

**Reference materials**:
- `reference/example-shippo-packing-slip.pdf` - Example of Shippo's default packing slip format

See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed integration strategy.

## Requirements

### Distributed Documentation Structure

This repository **REQUIRES** distributed CLAUDE.md files throughout the directory tree. Each subdirectory with significant functionality must have its own CLAUDE.md file:

- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code configuration and settings documentation
- `.github/CLAUDE.md` - GitHub Actions workflow documentation

**When adding new features or directories:**
- Create separate CLAUDE.md files in relevant subdirectories
- Do NOT expand this root CLAUDE.md file with detailed information
- Keep this root file focused on high-level repository overview only
- Distributed files keep context focused and only load relevant information when working in specific parts of the codebase

**README.md vs CLAUDE.md distinction:**

When a directory has a README.md, the CLAUDE.md should reference it. When a directory has both files:
- **README.md** - User-facing documentation (what the component does, detailed explanations, setup instructions, architecture overview)
- **CLAUDE.md** - Claude-specific development guidance (critical warnings, gotchas, common tasks with file:line references, testing patterns)
- **Pattern**: CLAUDE.md should reference README.md for overview/details and focus only on what Claude needs to work safely and effectively

### Documentation Maintenance

When making code changes, you MUST proactively suggest updates to relevant documentation:

- **CLAUDE.md files** - If you add/modify workflows, configuration files, or significant functionality, suggest updates to the relevant CLAUDE.md file in that directory
  - Keep CLAUDE.md files concise (prefer pointers over content duplication)
  - Avoid code snippets that will become outdated
  - Use file:line references to point to authoritative sources
  - Focus on high-level "what/why/how", not detailed descriptions
- **README.md files** - If changes affect user-facing documentation or setup instructions, suggest updates to the relevant README.md file
- **Proactive identification** - After completing code changes, explicitly check if documentation has become outdated and offer to update it

Do not wait for the user to ask about documentation. Identify when your changes have made documentation stale and suggest specific updates.

### Git Workflow

All commit messages MUST follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) syntax:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`

**Commit message requirements:**
- Keep messages brief and easy to parse - avoid lengthy descriptions
- Focus on specific, scannable details that help humans quickly identify what a commit contains
- **NEVER** add "🤖 Generated with Claude Code" or similar footers to commit messages
- **NEVER** add "Co-Authored-By: Claude" footers

### File Operations and Repository Root

**CRITICAL**: All file creation and modification operations MUST be relative to the git repository root.

- Before creating files or directories, identify the repository root with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
- NEVER create files outside the repository boundary - they will not be version controlled
- Use `git status` to confirm new files will be tracked by git
- If `git status` shows files as untracked, they are correctly within the repository
- If files don't appear in `git status`, they are outside the repository boundary

**Verification workflow:**
1. Run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to identify repository root
2. Create files/directories relative to that root
3. Run `git status` to confirm files are detected by git

### Technical Review Standards

Always fully evaluate the technical merits of questions and suggestions against relevant sources of truth and documentation.

**Do NOT** use validating phrases like "you're absolutely right" or similar affirmations. Instead:
- Verify claims against actual code, configuration files, and documentation
- Challenge suggestions when they conflict with established patterns or best practices
- Provide objective, evidence-based responses
- Respectfully disagree when warranted, citing specific technical reasons

Technical accuracy and honest assessment are more valuable than agreement.
